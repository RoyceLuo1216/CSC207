**For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your 
program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:
(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or
(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.**


**Principle 1: Equitable Use**
Our chatbot can be used by anyone; people who might have trouble using the GUI interface (i.e. people not well-versed 
scheduling systems such as the elderly), and people who simply prefer asking the chatbot to help them out with something
instead of interacting with the GUI themselves.


**Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**
Our program offers two modes of interaction: via the chatbot or through the GUI itself. Users can choose which mode of 
interaction they would like to use based on preference and need.


**Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**
Our JSwing elements and layout are designed in such a way to make working with the Scheduler as simple and intuitive as 
possible. Buttons have intuitive labels, the outputted schedule is easy to read, and finding the right things to click 
to do what you want is also intuitive. The chatbot is also simple to use, simply typing in what you want the chatbot to 
help you do.


**Principle 4: Perceptible Information**
Two potential features we could implement are:
Add color or high contrast themes to make the program easily accessible for visually impaired users.
Add a text-to-voice feature that ensures blind users can still use the program.


**Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**
To an extent, the edit use case is a good example of tolerance for error. Currently we are not storing IDs and events 
are implemented differently based on type, so the user cannot switch the name or type of the Event they have created. 
However, they can edit other details surrounding the event; specifically, the date, time, and days repeated 
(if applicable).


**Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**
Two potential features we could implement are:
A settings menu to increase the size of buttons and input fields. This minimizes the amount of physical effort the user 
needs to run the program.
Providing other ways to interact with the program, such as voice commands or keyboard shortcuts.


**Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**
One potential feature we could implement is:
A settings menu to adjust element sizes. This ensures there is appropriate space and size for our users to interact with
our program.
Making our program friendly to mobile devices. Making interactive elements large enough and spaced apart can help 
accommodate touch gestures like swiping or tapping.


**Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your
program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who
like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.**


We would market our program towards teams who need efficient time management. For example, restaurants with fast paced 
environments need to effectively allocate time during peak hours or special events. This program’s time estimation and 
event conflict AI feature can help streamline the process of managing preparation and staff schedules.


We would also market our programs towards individuals looking to manage multiple schedules. For example, students who 
have responsibilities outside of school, like sports or an after school job, can use the repeat event feature to 
schedule multiple events on set days. They can also use the event conflict and time estimation feature of the chatbot 
to set realistic goals and set times to study or relax.

**Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion
here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.**


Our program is likely to be less used by certain demographics, such as users who prefer physical planners for scheduling
or those less familiar with digital tools. For instance, older adults may struggle with learning how to use our system 
without additional support. Additionally, users with disabilities, such as visual impairments or dyslexia, might face 
difficulties due to the current design’s lack of accessibility features, such as low contrast or small, 
non-dyslexia-friendly fonts. However, incorporating improvements (like enhanced contrast settings, larger text options, 
color-coding, and text-to-speech functionality) could make the program more inclusive and accessible to these groups, 
ensuring that it accommodates a wider range of users.
