# Accessibility Report

## **Part 1 - Principles of Universal Design**
**For each Principle of Universal Design, write 2-3 sentences — or point form notes — explaining which features of your 
program adhere to that principle. If you do not have any such features, you can either:
(a) Describe features that you could implement in the future that would adhere to the principle or
(b) Explain why the principle does not apply to a program like yours.**

### **Principle 1: Equitable Use**
- The chatbot is accessible to a wide range of users, including those who may struggle with traditional GUI interfaces (e.g., older adults unfamiliar with scheduling systems).  
- Allows users to interact via natural language input, catering to individuals who prefer conversational interaction over navigating menus.  

### **Principle 2: Flexibility in Use**
- Provides two modes of interaction: a chatbot and a GUI.  
- Users can choose their preferred method of interaction based on their comfort and needs.  

### **Principle 3: Simple and Intuitive Use**
- Buttons are clearly labeled, making their function easy to understand at a glance.  
- The outputted schedule is formatted to be simple and easy to read.  
- Navigation is straightforward, allowing users to locate and use features quickly.  
- The chatbot accepts plain language input, enabling users to request assistance or complete tasks easily.  

### **Principle 4: Perceptible Information**
- High Contrast Themes: Adding color and contrast settings to improve accessibility for visually impaired users.  
- Text-to-Speech: Implementing a text-to-voice feature to allow blind users to interact effectively with the program.  

### **Principle 5: Tolerance for Error**
- Users can edit certain event details, such as the date, time, and recurrence, if mistakes are made during creation.  
- Current limitations prevent editing attributes like event name or type, which could be improved in future iterations to enhance error tolerance.  

### **Principle 6: Low Physical Effort**
- Adjustable Button and Input Sizes: Adding a settings menu to allow users to resize buttons and fields, reducing effort.  
- Alternative Interaction Methods: Implementing voice commands or keyboard shortcuts to minimize reliance on mouse clicks or touch gestures.  

### **Principle 7: Size and Space for Approach and Use**
- Adjustable Element Sizes: Introducing a settings menu to resize interface components, ensuring ample space for interaction.  
- Mobile Optimization: Adapting the program for mobile devices by spacing out and enlarging interactive elements for easier touch gestures.  

## **Part 2 - Marketing Target Audience**
**Write a paragraph (3-6 sentences) about who you would market your program towards, if you were to sell or license your
program to customers. This could be a specific category of users, such as "students", or more vague, such as "people who
like games". Try to give a bit more detail along with the category.**

### **Marketing Target Audience**
If marketed or licensed, our program would primarily appeal to students and working professionals who need to manage busy schedules efficiently.  
- **Students:** The program can assist with organizing classes, assignments, and extracurricular activities, helping them balance academic and personal commitments.  
- **Working Professionals:** It can help coordinate meetings, deadlines, and personal obligations, streamlining time management in fast-paced environments.  

The versatility of offering both chatbot and GUI options ensures the program meets the needs of tech-savvy users as well as those who prefer more traditional interfaces.  

## **Part 3 - Demographic Limitations**
**Write a paragraph about whether or not your program is less likely to be used by certain demographics. Your discussion
here should be informed by the content of our embedded ethics modules this term.**

Our program may be less accessible to certain demographics:  
- **Preference for Physical Planners:** Users who prefer physical planners might not find value in a digital scheduling system.  
- **Older Adults:** Those less familiar with technology might struggle to use the system without guidance or simplified onboarding.  
- **Users with Disabilities:** Individuals with visual impairments or dyslexia might face challenges due to the lack of high contrast, dyslexia-friendly fonts, or text-to-speech functionality.  

By incorporating inclusive features like adjustable fonts, enhanced contrast, and voice interaction, we could address these limitations and make the program more accessible to a broader audience.
